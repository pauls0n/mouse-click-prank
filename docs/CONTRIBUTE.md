# Steps to contribute

Hello! I'm glad that you are contributing to this tiny project.

I made this as a hobby project and didn't put much effort into it, so there are a lot of things you can do to make this app better.

But before that, let me show you **the procedures you should follow** to start contributing:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the forked repository
3. Make a new branch
4. Make your changes:

	- Read [documentation](DOCUMENTATION) to understand the project structure.
	- Don't make changes to the `build` and `dist` folder.

5. Commit after major changes
6. Run pyinstaller to build the executable file

	1. Navigate to the root of the repository folder
	2. Run the code 
	`pyinstaller build/mouse_click_prank.spec`
	3. After the process finishes, pyinstaller will have created the new `build` and `dist` folders. You can find the `mouse_click_prank.exe` file inside the `dist` folder.

7. Commit again and push the changes
8. Create a pull request
9. Happy open sourcing!
