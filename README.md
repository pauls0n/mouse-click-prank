# Mouse Click Prank Software

This is a really stupid widget that makes the computer play a sound effect of your choosing every time you click the mouse. <br>
Perfect for pranking your friends!

Feel free to contribute to this project!

> PS: I made this to practice Python and PyQt5. It's a dumb project lol and I didn't put much effort into it, so there might be lot of bugs.
